# ReadmeGenerator

This is my Readme generator. It is a dynamically generated readme.

I created this readme generator to showcase my talents as well present my creations to future employers.
I created this project by using javascript, node package.json, and gitignore.
My motivation in creating this generator to showcase my skills and talents.
This generator was created to enhance my skills and to continue to push myself to learn and grow, to recocrd take notes and see my progress from project to project, a before and after one can say.
The problem that this generator solves is it allows the user through the terminal to dynamically create a readme file.
I learned how to node and javascript on the backend side to create dynamic usage.
It has also strengthend my skills as a developer and has given me more confidence working with node.js and npms.
